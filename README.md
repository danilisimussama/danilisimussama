<h3>Data Science student focused on analytics and machine learning 🏎️🏍️🛵</h3>

<p>I am a 3rd-year Data Science student at the University of Debrecen.
My main interests are data analysis, applied AI, robotics, and motorsport.</p>

<p>I work primarily with Python for data analysis and basic machine learning.
I also have experience with SQL, Excel, SPSS, SAS, SAP, and Tableau.
I am currently in the process of learning ROS, YOLO, and Ubuntu</p>

<p>Most of my university coursework is already completed. That's why I'm writing my thesis, looking for a job, and enjoying life.</p>
