<h3>Data Science student focused on analytics and machine learning 🏎️🏍️🛵</h3>

<p>I am a 3rd-year Data Science (Business Informatics) student at the University of Debrecen.
My main interests are data analysis, applied AI, robotics, and motorsport.</p>

<p>I work primarily with Python for data analysis and basic machine learning.
I also have experience with SQL, Excel (including macros), SPSS, SAS, SAP, and Tableau.
I use both Ubuntu and Windows depending on the task.</p>

<p>Most of my university coursework is already completed, which allows me to focus on practical projects and my bachelor thesis.
I am currently looking for an internship or part-time role in data analytics or related fields, where I can apply my skills to real-world problems.</p>
